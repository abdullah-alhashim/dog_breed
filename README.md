# Dog Breed Project

In this project, I built a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm identifies an estimate of the dog breed. If supplied an image of a human face, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

The model is trained using dog and human images provided by Udacity. Since both the training data and the trained model parameters are big files, they are not provided in this repo.

The methodology and result of the training can be seen in the Jupyter Notebook dog_app.ipynb.
